# TransgenderHousingRelief

# The Trans Housing Relief project is to reboot and enhance the functionality of the now defunct Trans Housing Network. The primary aim is to provide a platform for trans, intersex and gender nonconforming people to search for and offer emergency housing, and secondarily to offer the same service for more permanent housing. We will be using Node.js, React, Express, and MongoDB/Mongoose to complete this project. 

# If you would like to join the project, let Nova or Leah know on the discord. Leah is the lead programmer and Nova is the Project Coordinator.
